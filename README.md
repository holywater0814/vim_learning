# vim_learning
My note on learning vim on terminal.
This repo contains the note on basic , daily usage of vim text editor. 
In upcoming days i will update this repository and customize on its own. 

vimtuto.txt contains the notes while .vimrc file contains my vim customization plugins.
I'll be making vimtuto_01, vimtuto_02 where 01 , 02 defines the days progress.


**Note** 
Please understand the concept and practice vimtuto_01 before beginning the vimtuto_02.
