#Day 5 of learning vim from basics 

**Chapter 2 Intermidate Vim continued **

1) Searching on file 
 --> In order to search any words or anything on a file we can easily search that , to do that we must be in 
     normal mode and then press </wordtobesearch> and then press enter. If we have more than one such word 
	 we need to press <n> on the keyboard to go to the next positon of that word. To get back we need to use 
	 <N>. 
 -->  If we need to search the backword we use <?wordtobesearch> and then press enter. If we have more than
     one such word we press <n> for going backword and <N> for going forward . It's the matter of choice as
	 per the requirement. 

2) Marking on frequently visiting place and visiting. 
 --> In order to mark certain line we use <m<character>> to mark that point as character, to visit that use 
     <'<character>>.
