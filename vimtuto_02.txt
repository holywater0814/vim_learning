Day 2 of learning vim from basics.
Chapter 2 ** vim keybindings **

1) Undo the changes 
--> In order to do undo we can't use ctrl+z because it will put the process in the background, we just go back 
    to normal mode then press key <u>. 
--> We can go n undos back by pressing n + <u> where n is the no of undos we need. 

2) Redo the changes 
--> In order to redo we use < ctrl+r> , the undo and redo can be change each after going normal mode and 
    insert mode .
--> As in undos we can go n redo by pressing n+ <ctrl+r> 

3) Visual Mode 
--> In order to enter into the visual mode we just go to the normal mode and then type <v> .
--> The visual mode is used to select a certain words or character so that we can edit , delete them as 
    per the requirement .
--> We can select by pressing the arrow key and delete by typing <d> . 
--> We can copy the selected item by pressing <y> key . y stands for yanking and it means coping.
--> We can paste the selected item by pressing <p> key . 

--> Almost all these keybindings can be used in different way. <dd> deletes the whole line , <yy> copies full
    line and we can paste the selected item with key <o> which will paste in new line below , while <O> will 
	paste in new line above the curser.

--> Deleteing and changing
    We can delete  a line without goint to insert mode by pressing <dd> , while we can delete a whole line
    and going to insert mode by pressing <cc> . 	


--> Replacing the character
    We can replace the character by pressing <r> followed by the replace character.

--> We can jump words by words by pressing <w> key, <W> needs to have space between wrods but, <w> can have 
    hyphen - in between to jump. 
	Example: This-has-hyphen-and-small-w-will-not-take-it-as-a-single-word. While big W will take that as
	         single word.
--> <w> and <W> will give forward movment while <b> and <B> will give backward movement.

--> We can combine the keys together so that we can use more efficiently.We know <d> is used to delete the 
    specific portion selected in vitual mode but <dw> can be used to delete a single word , or we can give 
	<ndw> to delete n words, also <d2b> to delete 2 words from backward.
--> If our curser is in the middle of the word then we can delete that word by pressing <diw> i.e. delete 
    in the word .
