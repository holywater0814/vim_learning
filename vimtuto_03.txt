# Day 3 of learning vim from basics 
***Chapter 2 *Vim keybindings * continued... ***

** As we saw earlier if our curser is in the middle of the word, we need to use <diw> and in ordre to change 
   the word we use <ciw> i.e change in a word .
** When we are in normal mode <e> goes to the end of word and <0> goes to the beginning of line whereas,
   $ goes to end of the particular line, just like <I> and <A> we saw earlier the only difference is 
   with <I> and <A> we automatically come into the insert mode while with <0> and <$> we stay in normal mode

** Combining <0>, <$> and <d> 
   if we type <d0> everything before the curser will be deleted.
   Similarly for <d$> everything after the curser will be deleted.

** Changing inside " , or copying inside "
   In order to change the whole content inside the quotatoin mark or curley brackers or any special character
   we can simply use <ci"> or <ci(> to change inside of that portion. 
   Example : Let us assume a simple python code --> print("Oh this can be change ") we can change that
   by typing <ci"> followed by what to change. and we can also do <ci(> too on that particular code. 

   Example2: 
   main()
   {
   oh this can also be done 
   } 

   In order to copy we just do <yi"> or <yi(> or for Example2 <yi{> 
   it will copy the content inside that particular file.

** The % operator : 
   If we have a big function and we see curley bracket opening and we don't know it's ending bracket then 
   we can navigate that using <%> key.
   And we can combine that too with <d> key to delete everything inside that bracket including that bracket 
   by typing <d%> 
   
   We can also copy the whole content including the brackets by typing <y%>

   Testingfunction()
   {
   hello 
   this is 
   testing 
   function 
   and i 
   wanna have 
   something to know 
   

   }
  
** Now if we wanna go before the start of some charcter : 
   We use <t<character>> to go just before that character. 
   Example: 
   "Hey i wanna go before the & character how can i do that ?"
   --> just type <t&> to go just before the '&' and <t?> to go just before '?'
   Note* the <t<character>> can be combined with any character wheather its alphanumeric or special character.



**Note all the keys can be combined with numbers ** 
For example : <5d5w> is 5 times delete 5 words , or <4y2w> is Four times yank(copy) 2 words.
