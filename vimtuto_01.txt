// This file is about getting started with vim 
// I will be making note on notion as well 
This is the day 1 of learning vim from basics.


Chapter 1 ** Basics **

//Opening the file in vim.
--> In order to open a file in vim we use the command vim <filename> , if there is no file then new file
    will  be created and if the file exists in working directory then that file will be open.


// Different modes in vim 
--> There are different modes in vim : Normal mode, Command mode, Insert mode.
--> Initially we are in normal mode when we type vim <filename>
 
--> in this mode every key has it's function , <:> will take us to command mode , <i> or <o> or <a> 
    will take us  to insert mode. <i> will write the character before the curser, <o> will write in new line ,
	while <a> will append after the curser .

--> in order to escape this insert mode we need to type the key <esc> , after pressing <esc> we reach to 
    normal mode.

--> <i> <o> and <a> can be used with shift key 
     i.e. <I> will take to the begining of the sentence . Similarly , <O> will take create a text above the 
	 current line. And similarly <A> will take you at the last of the line. 



// Updating/saving the content of file 
--> In order to do that we write content then use <esc> key to go into normal mode then we type <:w> then press
    <enter> key   then we will save the content . Now in order to write more content we go into the insert
	mode by pressing  <i> key. 


//  Exiting vim  
--> in order to exit vim we just use <esc :q>
--> if we are already in normal  mode and we wanna make change to the file then we can exit by <:wq>
--> if we are in normal mode and we don't wanna make the new changes i.e exit without saving then, <:q!>


// Getting line number 
--> In order to have  line number beside us, we need to go to normal mode then, type <:set number >
--> We can go n lines up or down by clicking n and arrow key , where n is the number 
--> Note that we must be in normal mode and we need to press both key at once.

// Navigating up and down using keys 
--> First make sure you are in normal mode, then use hjkl keys to navigate left down up  right . 
--> Also the <gg> will bring the curser into the first line (beginning of the file)
--> For the end of the file we use <G> and for specific position we use <linenumberG>


// Setting the Relative number 
--> In order to have line number respect to the current line we use <:set relativenumber> on normal mode .
 
// Setting the color scheme 
--> We can have different color scheme inside the vim by typing <:colorscheme <tab>> , when we click tab ,         it will show the available colors . 


***** Important note *****
--> All the setting will be gone once we quit the vim . 
    So inorder to make change permanent we will config ~/.vimrc file and write all the commands , 
    for example  <set number > <colorscheme ron> and many more .
